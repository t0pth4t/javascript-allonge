## How to run the examples {#online}

If you follow the instructions at [nodejs.org][install] to install NodeJS and JavaScript,[^whoa] you can run an interactive JavaScript [REPL][repl] on your command line simply by typing `node`. This is how the examples in this book were tested, and what many programmers will do.

On OS X, you have the option of running Safaris's JavaScript engine from the command line, or of installing a TextMate bundle. We didn't use this method to test the examples, [so proceed at your own risk](http://metaskills.net/2010/07/09/interactive-javascript-console-with-textmate/). But have fun!

Almost all browsers have a mechanism to function as JavaScript [REPLs][repl], allowing you to type JavaScript expressions into a debug console.

[^whoa]: Instructions for installing NodeJS and modules like JavaScript onto a desktop computer is beyond the scope of this book, especially given the speed with which things advance. Fortunately, there are always up-to-date instructions on the web.
