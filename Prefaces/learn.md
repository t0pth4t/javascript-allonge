## What Will You Learn?

Like *The Little Schemer*, *JavaScript Allongé* is valuable to the new programmer as well as the experienced developer. *JavaScript Allongé* will provide a deep grounding in the fundamentals such functions, values, references, closures, and functions that consume and return functions. It then progresses to advanced topics built on those fundamentals such as callbacks, combinators, method decorators, fluent APIs, and continuation-passing style.

### why you should read this book

The techniques presented in *JavaScript Allongé* will make you a better JavaScript programmer *now*. You'll learn how to write cleaner code that takes advantage of JavaScript's excellent support for making functional programs that are easy for humans to read. You'll also learn the fundamentals that will make you a better programmer when working with other languages such as JavaScript, Python, or Clojure.

### suggested prerequisites

No previous knowledge of JavaScript is assumed, although some knowledge of common programming concepts such as values, functions, references, strings, maps, and arrays will be immensely helpful.
