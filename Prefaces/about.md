## Why JavaScript Allongé?

*JavaScript Allongé* solves two important problems for the ambitious JavaScript programmer. First, *JavaScript Allongé* gives you the tools to deal with JavaScript bugs, hitches, edge cases, and other potential pitfalls.

There are plenty of good directions for how to write JavaScript programs. If you follow them without alteration or deviation, you will be satisfied. Unfortunately, software is a complex thing, full of interactions and side-effects. Two perfectly reasonable pieces of advice when taken separately may conflict with each other when taken together. An approach may seem sound at the outset of a project, but need to be revised when new requirements are discovered.

When you "leave the path" of the directions, you discover their limitations. In order to solve the problems that occur at the edges, in order to adapt and deal with changes, in order to refactor and rewrite as needed, you need to understand the underlying principles of the JavaScript programming language in detail.

You need to understand *why* the directions work so that you can understand *how* to modify them to work properly at or beyond their original limitations. That's where *JavaScript Allongé* comes in.

*JavaScript Allongé* is a book about programming with functions, because [JavaScript] is a programming language built on flexible and powerful functions. *JavaScript Allongé* begins at the beginning, with values and expressions, and builds from there to discuss types, identity, functions, closures, scopes, and many more subjects up to working with classes and instances. In each case, *JavaScript Allongé* takes care to explain exactly how things work so that when you encounter a problem, you'll know exactly what is happening and how to fix it.

Second, *JavaScript Allongé* provides recipes for using functions to write software that is simpler, cleaner, and less complicated than alternative approaches that are object-centric or code-centric. JavaScript idioms like function combinators and decorators leverage JavaScript's power to make code easier to read, modify, debug and refactor, thus *avoiding* problems before they happen.

*JavaScript Allongé* teaches you how to handle complex code, and it also teaches you how to simplify code without dumbing it down. As a result, *JavaScript Allongé* is a rich read releasing many of JavaScript's subtleties, much like the Café Allongé beloved by coffee enthusiasts everywhere.

### how the book is organized

*JavaScript Allongé* introduces new aspects of programming with functions in each chapter, explaining exactly how JavaScript works. Code examples within each chapter are small and emphasize exposition rather than serving as patterns for everyday use.

Following each chapter are a series of recipes designed to show the application of the chapters ideas in practical form. While the content of each chapter builds naturally on what was discussed in the previous chapter, the recipes may draw upon any aspect of the JavaScript programming language.
