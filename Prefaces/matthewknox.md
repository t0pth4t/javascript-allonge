## Foreword by Matthew Knox

A different kind of language requires a different kind of book.

JavaScript holds surprising depths--its scoping rules are neither strictly lexical nor strictly dynamic, and it supports procedural, object-oriented (in several flavors!), and functional programming.  Many books try to hide most of those capabilities away, giving you recipes for writing JavaScript in a way that approximates class-centric programming in other languages.  Not JavaScript Allongé.  It starts with the fundamentals of values, functions, and objects, and then guides you through JavaScript from the inside with exploratory bits of code that illustrate scoping, combinators, context, state, prototypes, and constructors.

Like JavaScript itself, this book gives you a gentle start before showing you its full depth, and like a Cafe Allongé, it's over too soon.  Enjoy!
